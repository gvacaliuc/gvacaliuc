I go to Rice University.

#### engineering stuff

I interned at Two Sigma during the summers of 2017 and 2018 where I worked on a
pandas data pipeline and integration between [Bazel](https://bazel.build) and
Two Sigma's build farm.  

Check out a talk I gave with Petros Eskinder (Two Sigma) at BazelCon 2018:
